Sure, let’s explain React lifecycle methods in a simple way that a 12-year-old can understand!

**Imagine your React component is like a toy robot with different stages in its life. Each stage has special tasks the robot needs to do.**

1. **componentDidMount:**

   **When It Happens:** When the robot is turned on and starts working for the first time.

   **What It Does:** It’s like setting up the robot with its first mission. Maybe you put some cool stickers on it or give it a new tool to use. In code, this is where you can load data or set up things that your robot needs to start.

2. **componentDidUpdate:**

   **When It Happens:** Whenever the robot gets new instructions or updates its mission.

   **What It Does:** If the robot needs to do something differently because of the new instructions, this is where it makes those changes. It’s like adjusting the robot’s settings after you tell it what’s new.

3. **componentWillUnmount:**

   **When It Happens:** When you’re about to put the robot away or stop using it.

   **What It Does:** Before you turn off or pack away the robot, it finishes up any last tasks. This might include unplugging it or putting away its tools. In your code, this is where you clean up things to avoid messes.

4. **componentWillMount (deprecated):**

   **When It Happens:** Before the robot starts working for the first time.

   **What It Does:** It’s like getting the robot ready before it starts its mission. But now, React doesn’t use this stage anymore because they have a better way to set things up.

5. **shouldComponentUpdate:**

   **When It Happens:** When you’re deciding if the robot should do its task again or not.

   **What It Does:** If the robot is told to do something new, you can decide if it really needs to do it right now or if it’s okay to wait. This helps the robot work faster by not doing unnecessary tasks.

**So, just like how you manage and take care of your toy robot, React lifecycle methods help manage and take care of your components in your app!**
